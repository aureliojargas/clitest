# Test file for the --prefix option
# Command blocks here are prefixed by 4 spaces (Markdown-style)
# Run with --prefix '    ' or --prefix 4

    $ echo "1"  #→ 1
    $ echo "2"
    2

# Any non-prefixed line closes the previous command block.
# The empty $ line is not needed.

# All other non-indented text is just ignored:

$ echo "ignored"  # not indented
$ echo "ignored"  #→ not indented

# Lines with the wrong indentation are also ignored

   $ echo "ignored"  # 3 spaces
     $ echo "ignored"  # 5 spaces

# Multiple blocks supported in a single file

    $ echo "3"
    3

# What about prefixed blocks with no commands?

    Prefixed line with no prompt: ignored.
    But wait, here comes a command:
    $ echo "4"
    4
    $
    Last command closed by the empty prompt.
    $ echo "5"  #→ 5
    Last command is auto-closed (inline output).

# Blank lines in the output are supported

    $ echo; echo "6"; echo; echo "7"
    
    6
    
    7

# Nice.
